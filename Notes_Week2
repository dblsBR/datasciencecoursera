Video 2 - COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

terminal commands (Command Lines)

Recipe for using commands:

COMMAND + FLAG + PARAMETERS

pwd = "print work directory": shows the path to the work directory

ls = lists files and folders in the current directory
ls -a = lists hidden and unhidden files and folders
ls -al = lists details for hidden and unhidden files and folders

-a and -al are FLAGS

cd = "change directory"
	cd takes as an argument the directory you want to visit (path)
	cd with no argument takes you to your home directory
	cd .. allows you to change directory to one level above your current directory

mkdir = "make directory"
	mkdir takes as an argument the name of the directory you're creating

touch = creates an empty file
	Ex: touch test_file = creates a new empty file called test_file

cp = copy an file
	cp uses two arguments: the file to be copied and the path to where you want the file to be copied
	cp can also be used for copying the contents of directories, but you must use the -r ("recursive") flag
	Ex: cp -r Documents More_docs copies contents of Documents into More_docs

rm = "remove": takes the name of the file you want to remove (delete) as its arguments
	rm -r deletes the entire directories and their contents.
	BE CAREFULL! There's no way to undo an rm

mv = "move": move Name_File Directory
	mv can used to rename files: move old_name new_name

echo: prints whatever arguments you provide
	Ex: echo Hello World! 

date: prints the date
